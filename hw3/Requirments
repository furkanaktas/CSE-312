string filename;
string creatTime, modifTime, last_access;
char data[256];
int fileSize;
int cursor;
int usedBlock;

these are file infos (fileAttributes) , and to keep all files  i use 4096 size  fileAttributes array (files).

when file is created, it locates in files array. when it's data field (char[256]) is full, it locates the next index as countinues of that file and  files that after the this index are shifted as they are needed(related the adding new blocks).   


P2 reads for 50 nums, and it should be any file for that it runs.


debug mode 1 ,  it prints all info of opened files
debug mode 0 , it prints  all info except data field  of all files, same as DirRead
